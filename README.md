* You can not progress past Nugget Bridge until Misty has been beaten
* All rooms on the S.S. Anne that had trainers have been locked
* You can not enter into Rocket Hideout until Erika has been beaten

**Plus all changes from the original Faster FireRed Patch:** 
* You must talk to Mom to start your adventure, but don't worry, she has something to show you
* The Oak Parcel quest is shortened by having the Mart Employee and Oak meet you part way
* Repel's will prompt you to use another one when your current one wears off
* TM's on the ground are Gold instead of Red
* Pokemon Renamers have been added to all PokeCenters
* Faster PokeCenter animations
* The PC Item is now in the lab instead of in the PC, allowing people to savestate in the lab and still have the PC item
* Bill no longer asks you to go to Sevii after beating Blaine but he is still located in the Cinnabar Island PokeCenter
* An NPC was added in Viridian in the house next to the Old Man that can boost the Friendship of a Pokemon in your party
* There is a Nurse stationed in Viridian Forest. She will only heal your Pokemon if none of the Pokemon in your party are poisoned.
